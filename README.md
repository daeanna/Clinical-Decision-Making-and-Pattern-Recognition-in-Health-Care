**Clinical Decision Making and Pattern Recognition in Health Care
**

This repository contains a project that is about clinical decision making and pattern recognition in health care. It includes the deliverables a written report and a hackathon proof of concept. It demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to analyze health data.

**Introduction**
This project explores the use of chain reasoning, agentic generative AI, classification, prediction, inference, clustering, and time-series anomaly detection for treatment, payment, and operations (TPO) in health care. The goal is to improve patient outcomes, enhance operational efficiency, and reduce costs through advanced data analysis techniques.

**Project Structure**
`data/`: Contains the simulated health data used for analysis.
`notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with analysis and visualizations.
`scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
`report/`: The written report in Microsoft Word format.
`README.md`: This file.

**Installation**
To run the repository, first you need to have Python installed. Next, you can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-decision-making.git
   cd healthcare-decision-making
   ```

2. Run the data analysis script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_analysis.py
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/
   ```

**Data Analysis**
The data analysis includes:
Simulating health data for heart rate, steps taken, and body temperature.
Analyzing trends and detecting anomalies in the data.
Visualizing the relationships between different health metrics.
Building a linear regression model to predict heart rate based on steps taken and body temperature.

**Results**
The results of the analysis are presented in the form of visualizations and a predictive model. Key findings include:
Average heart rate, steps taken, and body temperature over the simulated period.
Detection of anomalies in heart rate data.
Visualization of the relationship between heart rate and other health metrics.
- Comparison of actual vs. predicted heart rate using the linear regression model.
